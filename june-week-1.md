# June: Week 1
## Todo
* Study android development
    - Install Android Studio
* Finish a poll system using django (django-tutorial)
    - Install the language in our terminal
    - Install several IDE's for python
    - Study native python
    - Study the django framework for python
 
## Done
* Poll System using Django
    - Installed django in terminal and pycharm as the IDE
    - Followed the 10 part tutorial in the django website
    - Took 6 hrs.
* Assigned to 2 projects based on skillset and preference
    - Frontend developer on two projects. 

## To be done
* Enrollment System using Django (Mini Project)
    - Students can enroll in a subject given (can be multiple subjects)
    - Computes for the tuition based on the units on a subject

## Things learned
* Learning is much better/fun when done in groups
    - We were given 8 problems and it must be solved by your preferred programming language; it is an individual coding challenge but you can help or be helped by a friend. I was stuck in a problem and a friend pointed out a mistake in my algorithm, thus solving it.


## Hardest task done this week
    - The hardest task is probably adapting to a new language that is not taught in my curriculum which is python. Learning the coding conventions and how to debug a mistake ate most of my time. I solved it by studying the native python language, the django documentation itself, and a little help from the stackoverflow community.
