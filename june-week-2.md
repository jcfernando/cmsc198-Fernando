## Things learned
* Reading the API really helps
    - Learning a new language, reading the documentation for that language really helps; not only the native python but the django framework documentation really helps. Sometimes, learning by yourself isn't a bad thing. It teaches a student to learn and adapt to different things, given that in the industry different languages must be learned quickly to work with the team and to code properly. 

## Hardest task done this week
- My hardest task this week is creating the Data Models and receiving a form submission in an html file. In creating the data models, I had problems with a data in which time is the only input; it has to be a time stamp because it will be compared to other time. I had to read a stack of documentation to come up with a proper solution. In the form submission, the user can submit an object of subjects, thus i had problems parsing it as on object. The solution I came up with is by using the is by getting the subject id then passing it as an array of subject id's then in the method I will search in an array of objects searching for the id's passed from the form and adding it to another array of object to be shown in a different html file
