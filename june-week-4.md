## Things learned
* Consulting for a problem is not that scary: 
    - I was absent for a day because a problem came up and during the time I was not present, the basic templating system for django was taught. I was scared to ask for help from my superviser because I never really consult in college and they might judge me for being illiterate. I was really thankful that the superviser was the one who approached me and encouraged me to ask questions if I'm having a hard time. Since then, I'm pestering her with questions. ;)

## Hardest task done this week
- Hardest task done this week was creating the templating system and the error handling. In the templating system, I had to follow certain coding convention to assure that static files would be loaded in the page and it was really hard since you have to change the settings of your whole project, so you have to adjust every url in your page to suit the convention. It was hard because there was tons of code to comb through and one mistake can create a big problem for the page. As for the error handling, it was hard at first to debug which error causes the problem and to find a "witty" solution to that problem. I solved it by incorporating the Try-Catch function I learned in Java. Thank god for that.
